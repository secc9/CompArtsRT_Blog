      Week 6 (wc Nov_14_22)
    </h3>

    <p>
      This week we looked at artificial intelligence and machine learning.
      Artificial intelligence and machine learning are two very different things. The first is the expectation that machines can have intelligence and the second is that the machine can learn.
      It appears that there are two kinds of AI. Both kinds are represented/portrayed in Hollywood media which makes its understanding of it more digestible. In Kubrick’s 2001, A Space Odyssey, HAL, the space stations operating system is built on strict rules. And the machine in Garland’s Ex- Machina is based on testing.
      Ai can be trained on rules but when things go wrong it stops.  Or it can be placed into an environment and run sequences until it learns the outcome.
      The machine can learn through a set of presubscribed rules, but is it possible for the machine to think for itself depending on these rules, or just it just rigidly stick to them and claim that the input is broken if something doesn’t work?
      The other option is to train the AI. Feed it countless images of trees, traffic lights and terrain. Teaching it to recognise these things over time so it builds up a storage and ‘memory’ to recall from when making decisions. Maybe because a Tesla ran over an old person once, it now recognises an old person and next time will endeavour to miss them.

  Week 5 (wc Oct_31_22)
</h3>
<p>

  This weeks class we just talked about the upcoming group projects. We tried to find research we are interested in
  and from then attempt to group up with someone with similar interests. I managed to group with someone but I have no idea what we are
  going to do. We have a brief meeting this week on teams to hopefully discuss something? We settled on making some kind of accessible video
  synthesizer which can be used with obsolete hardware, this eliminating the need to constantly purchase new items.

    Week 4 (wc Oct_24_22)
  </h3>
  <p>
   This week we discussed Ursula Le Guin’s essay “The Carrier Bag of Theory and Sarah Ahmed’s conclusion Queer Use. </p>
   <p>
   In Le Guin's Carrier bag of Fiction the author puts forward the idea that technology is regarded as a weapon.
    The essay suggests that what if, instead of idolising the weapon and everything ‘exiting’ that surrounds it (the story, the hero),
    we instead idolise the container. Maybe the idea of the container is more interesting?
    Even though the container may be boring it can at least hold things. Food, items, concepts.
    Using this ideology would have undoubtedly avoided a great many conflicts.
    Due to the weapon, hero and story being first we undoubtedly have a history full of conflict.
    The sugguestion is that the birth of the weapon eventually leads us to death due to war.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should think about what we carry and what we can carry.
    The body is essentially just a lump of meat, but it has the possibility to be a container.
    Maybe even the greatest container. Holding onto complex and non-complex ideas. Storing more and more.
    Even possibly mixing them together as you would to make a dough for bread.
</p>
<p>
I currently only have very little to offer on the idea of queer use. What is queer use?
Not only is it about the generally regarded term for queerness,
how in more modern times the term has been ‘queered’ into use as a homosexual slur, but
the way we are/were looking at the term taken from its origin. To mean oddness, to misuse, to be strange.
To queer something would be to use it in the purpose it wasn’t intended for. This way the use of an object/artifact.
A possible different way to question the norm. A way to make something opaque. To let it be seen.
</p>

<p>
  Hopefully we can learn to walk the queer path. That is, the path that hasn't really been walked before.
  By doing this we can ask new questions, use things in new ways, offer new approaches to ways we have been conditioned into doing.
  To be queer is to be walking open into the future.

    <h3>
      Week 3 (wc Oct_17_22)
    </h3>
    <p>
      This week we looked at exploring what critical practices are.
      There were various headings of practice, but the main takaway was that art is a fluid context with no fixed definition
      and has no fixed boudries. Whatever the artist creates expands to then include that inside the term "art".
      We discussd the terms and boundries of the hacker, maker and the artist, and how, over time the lines between these
      have become more blurred. I think now, the artist is a combination of all of these. By hacking and making the maker becomes the artist.
      The artist questions how things are made. By hacking into technologies to look inside them, we can question how and why technologies
      are made the way they are, and by tinkering and tweaking these technologies the artist can offer up new ways to use them as well as
      extending the use for who they were made for.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke breifly about the the MAKE makers movement that came to prominence in the 2010's and how it turned out to be, maybe unwittingly to the CEO's,
      a double edged sword. In the Critical Makers Reader introduction by Bogers and Chiappini, they explore the rise and fall of the company and the questions
      its existence as a company threw up. Their Modus Operandi was to empower people with the ability to make, create and program devices and software so that
      a person could eventually make something useful to themselves. A possible critisim was that whilst producing step by step guides to make things
      they were also manufacturing kits which could be purchased for said guides. It could be said (from my own experience it is a very valid point) that by following
      the guides the maker was only being taught how to follow instructions and not being taught the knowledge they need to step outside of this and begin to create
      their own devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end of the MAKE movement did raise questions.
      <strong> <em>
         Where are these cheap electronics kits coming from? Who is making them? Who are the end users? Who is benefiting?
       </em>  </strong>
       It is important as an artist to look into these questions. The Isabel Stenger quote <strong>"Thinking in the presence of the victims"</strong> was
       talked about. Before embarking on making it is important to think about who the end user will be. Thinking beyond the terms of
       "this blender will be great for me and my smoothies" to much further down the line of where will the appliance end it's life?
      <a href="https://youtu.be/JXDrIvShZKU" target="_blank">Most likely in a landfill in Africa with children and young adults burning e-waste for "profit". </a>
      Also it's important not to forget the beginning of its life. The mining to be done for the products to make the components and the working conditions for the people
      making the cheap and affordable device that is being purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion we should question every part of the process. Why. Because we can. We have the privilege to be able to question.
        To question why. To question how. To question if there's another way. As artists we are to question everything.

  <!-- Week 2 -->

  <div class="week_02">
    <h3>
      Week 2 (wb Oct_10_22)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Week two was an overview of software and what computational arts is and means.
      Software is about liveness and matter. I'm not really sure what the meaning of this is.
      Possibly that the software can create things. That it can create objects and work. It can be used in a manner that
      allows the user to work and interact with it in a way not previously thought about.
    </p>

    <p>
      The essay <strong>System Aesthetics</strong> by Jack Burnham (1968) suggests that artists are taking a new approach to the creation of
      work. One that is no longer based on the material and aesthetic outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the shifts in global economies, power and technologies, information and the systems it uses has now become more powerful
      than the traditional forms of wealth. Because of this shift the outcome of the product is no longer a viable option.
      Importance is now placed on the systems that promote and sustain life. Software is also about the systems,
      informations and processes that is conceals. Behind the slick graphical user interfaces
      is a whole world of the previously mentioned systems and processes. This possibly means that the idea of computational arts is that
      these processes are no longer hidden, but brought into the light and questioned by the artists which use them.
    </p>


    <p>
      Sytems viewpoints is about looking at the system. Examining the ongoing relationships between systems.
      Burnham writes that these are organic and non organic systems such as neighbourhoods, farming and transportation.
      What seems like general infrastructure between the natural an human world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist has now become an entity that questions. No longer is the artist the maker of aesthetically pleasing objects.
      The artist now poses questions. Questions that may not have answers.
      Questioning existing systems and processes and pointing out different ways to approach them has become the currency of artists.
      Questioning the sytems that govern the human and organic. These questions/ideas/concepts are now more important that the outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Winne Soon was also mentioned regarding her thoughts on software not only being tehnical, but also cultural.
      Her key concepts were that software has a sense of invisibility to it, that it performs tasks and that it can also be generative.
      The idea that software is medium, much like any other (paintbrush, pencil, clay) can allow the computatinoal artist to think beyond
      the idea of only output, but that the internal processes and can now be used as a material.
    </p>

    <!-- I should write more in here regarding the Gillespie essay on algorithms -->

    <p>
      The Algorithms essay by Tarleton Gillespie brought up some interesting questions regarding the algorithm and how it is used by
      different communities. Most interesting was the use of an algorithm as a talisman. This talisman can ward off evil.
      The fact that corporations use this term as a get out clause for any mistakes they may have caused.
      The alogrithm can be blamed and not the company. By allowing themselves to blame an algorithm, they can distance themselves from something.
      Dehumanizing the problem by blaming the alogrithm instead of the corporation allows forgivness.
      It is suggested that work needs to be put into this area to 'make' corporations shoulder the blame they 'deserve'.

    </p>


    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I should write a coherant summary/conclusion here but I'm still not sure what I'm supposed to say or how I feel about this.
      <!--I think going forward I should be attempting to look more closely and questioning-->

    <!--WEEK 1 -->

    <h3>
      Week 1 (wb Oct_3rd_22)
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’m not so sure on what to write here. I guess that it is just reflecting on yesterday’s lecture/intro.

      The start of the lecture was an introduction to the upcoming module through term 1, looking at how the course is structured,
      what we will be looking at week to week and discussing the group and individual projects/deadlines etc.

      We looked at some key points in the Snelting article such as the politics of Open-Source software, collaboration,
      the ease and difficulty of the use of packaged software and how it ‘should’,
      with practice, disappear into the background (but more than often it does not).
      After a break we were shown some examples of previous students work and what makes a good and not so good project.
      The main thing here is to document your process and working. After this we introduced ourselves and
      talked about relative projects we had worked on.
